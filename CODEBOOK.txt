#============================================ADDITION TO CODE BOOK====================================
This file is a modified version of the original code book for this project to explain additions based
on original data.  See original source for additional files.

ActivityMeans.txt
=================
This file contains the summary data.  The following new summary variables have been created for each 
participant and feature combination.  This data summarizes both the test and training data.  There 
were 30 participants and each participant has summary measurements for all 561 features.
(Units for the features is shown in the original code book.  Data retains same units for each feature.) 

PersonID - Identifier for person in the study 
Features - The feature related to each measurement in the row
LAYING_MEAN - Mean of laying data 
SITTING_MEAN - Mean of sitting data 
STANDING_MEAN - Mean of standing data 
WALKING_MEAN - Mean of walking data  
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS_MEAN - Mean of walking downstairs data
WALKING_UPSTAIRS_MEAN - Mean of walking upstairs data
LAYING_SD - Standard Deviation of laying data
SITTING_SD - Standard Deviation of sitting data
STANDING_SD - Standard Deviation of standing data
WALKING_SD - Standard Deviation of walking data
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS_SD - Standard Deviation of walking downstairs data
WALKING_UPSTAIRS_SD - Standard Deviation of walking upstairs data

Assignment3_Script.R
=====================
This file contains the script for how the data was processed.  It will download the data from 
the source provided by the Getting and Cleaning data assignment description.  It will
then process the data and save "ActivityMeans.txt" in a newly created folder called "working."  
This folder can be easily deleted to return the computer to its original state.  

The original data is deleted automatically after "ActivityMeans.txt" has been created.  If you want 
to keep the original data comment out the last line in the script.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
